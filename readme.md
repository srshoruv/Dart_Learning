So this is the first step of learning dart language. So I am learning it from YouTube channel.

Today is 20th December 2025, Sunday. 7:58 PM

intput / output
import "dart:io";

to int - int.parse(stdin.readLineSync()!);
float/double - same as before
string - stdin.readLineSync();

1. List of int,string,double etc

to insert - l.add(); // just like push_back

check if exists - l.constains(); // checks if exists

access / modify - same as others

delete - l.remove(); // only pass the element (not index)
find index - l.indexOf(); // -1 if does not exists

length - l.length

2. Functions - same as other languages

return_type function_Name()
{
    // statements
    return;
} // semicolor is not required

3. Conditional Statement - same

if (condition)
{

}
else
{

}

switch - case is also similar


4. For loops & While loops are same as other language

5. For (in) loops - similar to for each loop but slightly different syntax

for (int num in numbers)
{
    print(num);
}

6. Comments are the same
